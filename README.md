This is a simple python web crawler built specifically to crawl archive-it.org

Install
---------------------
~~~ sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

Execution
---------------------
~~~ sh
python main.py
~~~

Once running, the script will create two files in the directory where the python file is located.
One will be crawlerLog.log for all log files and the other will be crawler.db for the sqlite database.
